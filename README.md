- 👋 Hi, I’m @g1t-innit (of course not my real name)
- 👀 I’m interested in bugs... I mean coding. I am also interested in various other things such as music, books, video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on my career. I've been lucky enough to work as a front-end intern in a company. (They have no idea how many bugs i'm going add to their projects)
- 😄 Pronouns: I hate this sh*t. I also hate LGBTQHD+ Ultra guys. If you're a normal person, and all you care about is coding, then we can have a conversation.
- 👨‍🎓 Learning new things is what i really enjoy. So, if you got anything interesting about programming skills, please share it with me.
- ⚡ All I really want is to make good friends with the ones who really like to do something good. I mean something good in the world of programming.
- 👨‍💻 Finally, keep calm and enjoy coding!
